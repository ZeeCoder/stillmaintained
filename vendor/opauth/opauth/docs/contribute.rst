Contribute
==========

As with any open source project all help is very welcome. You can help by submitting pull requests or issues at github.
Also documentation changes can be done by github pull requests.
Furthermore you can :ref:`create <create>` your own strategy if your favorite provider isn't :doc:`listed</strategies>`
yet and tell us about it, so we can add it to the list.

If you want to have your offline documentation, cd to the docs directory and run::

    make html

Next you can open up ``docs/_build/html/index.html`` in your browser to view this documentation locally.

Also blogging, tweeting or promoting Opauth in any other way will help the project.
